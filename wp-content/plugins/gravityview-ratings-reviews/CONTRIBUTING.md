How to Contribute
=================

First install this plugin by cloning this repo. Install [Gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/)
if you're going to edit files in `assets` directory.

## Working with assets

1. Install Gruntjs

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run it

   ```
   grunt
   ```

3. Edit `assets/js/*` or `assets/css/*`. The `watch` task will automatically
   compile your assets.

4. Never ever edit generated files:

   * `assets/css/*.css` (please edit the `assets/css/*.scss` files)
   * `assest/js/*.min.js` (please edit the non-minified js files)
